## Simple Python Code :
```python 
  print("Hello Python !")
  print("What is 1 Plus 1? ", 1+1)
```
# Another Detailed Code: 
```python
print("=========================================\n")

# input a which is a number
a = int(input("Enter A Number : "))

# input b which is a floating number
b = float(input("Enter B Float : "))

# input a which is a string
c = input("Enter String : ")
print("\n=========================================\n")

# special format specifiers
print(f"Values are: \nA: ${a}\nB: ${b}\nC: ${c}")
print("\n - New line\n")
print("\t - Tab Space\n")
print("\v - Vertical Tab Space\n")
print("\' - Single and \" Double Quote\n")

print("\n============ The End ===================\n")

# Python
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.

Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.
